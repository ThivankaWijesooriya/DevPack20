MySQL

SELECT 
FieldA , 
GROUP_CONCAT(FieldB ORDER BY FieldB SEPARATOR ',') AS FieldBs
FROM TableName
GROUP BY FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;

Oracle & DB2

SELECT 
FieldA ,
LISTAGG(FieldB, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY FieldB) AS FieldBs
FROM TableName
GROUP BY FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;

PostgreSQL

SELECT FieldA ,
STRING_AGG(FieldB, ',' ORDER BY FieldB) AS FieldBs
FROM TableName
GROUP BY FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;

SQL Server

SQL Server ≥ 2017 & Azure SQL

SELECT 
FieldA , 
STRING_AGG(FieldB, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY FieldB) AS FieldBs
FROM TableName
GROUP BY FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;

SQL Server ≤ 2016 (CTE included to encourage the DRY principle)

WITH CTE_TableName AS (
      SELECT FieldA, FieldB
      FROM TableName)
SELECT t0.FieldA
     , STUFF((
       SELECT ',' + t1.FieldB
       FROM CTE_TableName t1
       WHERE t1.FieldA = t0.FieldA
       ORDER BY t1.FieldB
       FOR XML PATH('')), 1, LEN(','), '') AS FieldBs
FROM CTE_TableName t0
GROUP BY t0.FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;

SQLite
Ordering requires a CTE or subquery

WITH CTE_TableName AS (
       SELECT FieldA, FieldB
       FROM TableName
       ORDER BY FieldA, FieldB)
SELECT 
FieldA , 
GROUP_CONCAT(FieldB, ',') AS FieldBs
FROM CTE_TableName
GROUP BY FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;
Without ordering

SELECT 
FieldA ,
GROUP_CONCAT(FieldB, ',') AS FieldBs
FROM TableName
GROUP BY FieldA
ORDER BY FieldA;
