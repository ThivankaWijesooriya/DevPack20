To delete a single file, use the rm or unlink command followed by the file name:

unlink filename

rm filename

If the file is write-protected, you will be prompted for confirmation, as shown below. 
To remove the file type y and hit Enter. Otherwise, if the file is not write-protected, 
it will be deleted without prompting.


To delete multiple files at once, 
use the rm command followed by the file names separated by space.

rm filename1 filename2 filename3

You can also use a wildcard (*) and regular expansions to match multiple files.
For example, to remove all. pdf files in the current directory,
use the following command:

rm *.pdf

When using regular expansions, first list the files with the ls command 
so that you can see what files will be deleted before running the rm command.


Use the rm with the -i option to confirm each file before deleting it:

rm -i filename(s)


To remove files without prompting even if the files are write-protected
pass the -f (force) option to the rm command:

rm -f filename(s)

You can also combine rm options. For example, to remove all .txt files 
in the current directory without a prompt in verbose mode, use the following command:

rm -fv *.txt
