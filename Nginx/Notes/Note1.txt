“network error: connection refused”, putty error

Install open-ssh in target Linux machine solved my problem

The following are the list of possibilities of this error:

1) Common cause is - Your IP is blocked or not whitelisted in the server which can be done by editing the file at /etc/csf/csf.conf

2) Disable the windows firewall settings and check..

The above two things should work in most of the cases

3) This is very unusual and when the above two options fails it is very difficult to find the solution

In this case the traceroute to the server host or IP works usually but putty fails
port 22 looks normal and working but connection fails and restarting SSH (service ssh restart) also does not work
reboot or restart the server but still fails
Adding IP in firewalls or whitelisting the local IP may not workout
This case generally happens when the server is migrated or new server. IP of the old server might be whitelisted locally, 
but don't have port 22 open, or some other local filtering is occurring for this new IP but not the old server IP..

In this case you need to change the port to some 522 or 530 some unusual port will help in sorting it out.. 
The same port you have to use for the SFTP connection also .. where as FTP connections works normally..

or you have to whitelist the IP locally or open the TCP in and out to port 22 if you want to use the port 22..


*********QUESTION 2**********************

How do I find my internal ip address?
These commands will tell you all network info

ip add 
ifconfig -a

If as you say it only gives you 127.0.0.1 then there are two options:

Your network card is not attached or not recognized by the system

Your network DHCP server is not runnning or not connected

This will give you just ip address without any extra information.
hostname -I


*********QUESTION 3**********************
How to check whether ssh running ?

You can just open system-monitor and see if sshd is running in the processes tab.
ssh-agent should be by default in 10.04, but sshd will not be unless you have installed openssh-server.

You can do it in the command line or terminal with
ps -aux | grep ssh (Only lines containing ssh will be shown.)

I use ssh occasionally to network the family machines, but stop sshd from running at boot time by adding the line
service ssh stop

Then when I want to use my machine as a server and connect from the other machines, I start sshd with the command
sudo service ssh start


*********QUESTION 4**********************
ssh installed but I get the error: Failed to start ssh.service: Unit ssh.service not found ?

The ssh binary, the SSH client, is provided by the openssh-client package, which is installed on your system.
The ssh service runs the SSH server, provided by the openssh-server package, which isn’t installed on your system.
The ssh package is a meta-package which installs both the client and the server.

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

How to install Nginx in Ubuntu ?


using ubuntu apt package manager
Get latest version of all the packages
sudo apt-get update

Install nginx
apt-get install nginx

process cmd to verify installation

ps aux | grep nginx

a=all users
u=listing detailed information
x=include boot processes

nginx server would by default be working and listening on http port 80

apt package manager automatically start nginx (No need to manually -> sudo service nginx start)

ubuntu ships with apt package manager and centos ships with yum package manager
