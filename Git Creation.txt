// How to sync with a remote Git repository?
Assuming their updates are on master, and you are on the branch you want to merge the changes into.

git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/<repo-name>.git
git pull origin master
Also note that you will then want to push the merge back to your copy of the repository:

git push origin master
