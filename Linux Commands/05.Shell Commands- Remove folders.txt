To remove an empty directory, use either rmdir or rm -d followed by the 
directory name:


rm -d dirname

rmdir dirname


To remove non-empty directories and all the files within them, 
use the rm command with the-r (recursive) option:


rm -r dirname


If a directory or a file within the directory is write-protected, 
you will be prompted to confirm the deletion.


To remove non-empty directories and all the files without being prompted, 
use rm with the -r (recursive) and -f options:


rm -rf dirname


To remove multiple directories at once, use the rm -r command followed
by the directory names separated by space.


rm -r dirname1 dirname2 dirname3


Same as with files you can also use a wildcard (*) and 
regular expansions to match multiple directories.
