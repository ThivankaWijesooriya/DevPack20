If you are using TortoiseSVN, right-click on a file and then select TortoiseSVN / Add to ignore list. This will add the file/wildcard to the svn:ignore property.

svn:ignore will be checked when you are checking in files, and matching files will be ignored. I have the following ignore list for a Visual Studio .NET project:

bin obj
*.exe
*.dll
_ReSharper
*.pdb
*.suo
You can find this list in the context menu at TortoiseSVN / Properties.
