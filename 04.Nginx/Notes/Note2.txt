NOTE 2 - NGINX

*********QUESTION 1**********************
Remote Host Identification has Changed ( Host key verification failed )

This is a standard ssh error

remove host entry from known_hosts

~/.ssh/known_hosts

remove host entry from cmd

ssh-keygen -R hostname
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.8.10

-R = Remove

yum package manager does not automatically start nginx so use (Only adds nginx as a Service);

sudo service nginx start

sudo service nginx stop


use command to update package in centos
yum check-update
