// Working with var

var name = "Thivanka";
console.log(name);

//Working with let

let age = 25;
console.log(age);
age = 30;
console.log(age);

//Working with const (Behaves like final keyword in java)

// 01. Const needs to be initialized during declaration
//const school; => Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

const school = "Royal";

// 02. Const cannot be reinitialized
//school = "Visakha"; => Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// 03. Const does not allow reinitialization but properties of Arrays and Objects
//can be mutated (Modified)

//************* Const with Objects *******************

const object1 = { name: "thivanka", age: 25 };
// name: thivanka, age: 25
object1.name = "lahiru";
object1.age = 30;
//name: lahiru, age: 30

/* Even though properties of the Const object can be modified
The object itself CANNOT be reinitialized as then
you are creating a whole new object allocating memory*/

// object1 = { name: "lahiru", age: 30 }; => Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

//************* Const with Arrays ********************

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
arr.push(5, 6); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
